~~Jenkins seed job is configured to look for jobs in `jenkins-playground/jobs/*.groovy` and `jenkins-playground/jobs/**/*.groovy` paths. 
This repo's is checked in Jenkins Controller in `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/seed/jenkins-playground` (seed being the Jenkins seed job). 
So a manual `git pull` is required whenever a new job commit is pushed to remote.~~
